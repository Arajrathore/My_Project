GUESS THE NUMBER
This is a guess the random number game. The number is randomly generated and the user can guess the number and if the guessed number is more than the actual number output would be too high and if it is less than the actual number then the output would be too less.
If user guessed it right the output would be You win and then the program will end.
Thank you......
